# Emacs Unsplash Themes

A collection of unsplash wallpapers with contrasting Emacs themes.

This isn't really done, but showcases a series of theme colors with wallpapers, mostly for my own reference. I use the [ElementaryOS](elementary.io/) app [Fondo](https://appcenter.elementary.io/com.github.calo001.fondo/) to find wallpapers from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com).

See [installation](./INSTALL.md) to get started.
